# Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 - 3.12
* [Installed Infineon OpenOCD](https://github.com/Infineon/openocd/releases)
* Ensure the KitProg3 programming mode is **CMSIS-DAP Bulk**


# Documentation
* [PSoC64 Secure MCU Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/Infineon/edgeprotecttools/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# Standalone Executable
Edge Protect Tools can be used as a standalone application. The executable can be found in the `tools/edgeprotecttools/bin` directory of the Edge Protect Security Suite or Early Access Pack installation.

# Installing From Sources
Alternatively Edge Protect Tools can be installed from the sources as a Python package. The source code is located in the `tools/edgeprotecttools/src` directory of the Edge Protect Security Suite or Early Access Pack installation.

Install Python 3.12 on your computer. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Set up the appropriate environment variable(s) for your operating system.

## Installing Package
Make sure that you have the latest version of pip installed, use
the following command.
```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Run the following command, from the Early Access Pack or Edge Protect Security Suite directory.
```bash
$ python -m pip install tools/edgeprotecttools/src
```

## Updating Package
To update the already installed package, run the following command from the Early Access Pack or Edge Protect Security Suite directory.
```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall tools/edgeprotecttools/src
```

*Note*: There may be some pip dependency resolver errors. In most cases, these can be safely ignored.

*Note*: You can use the following command to show the path to the installed package
`$ python -m pip show edgeprotecttools`.


# Supported Devices
Use `device-list` command for output of the supported devices list.
```bash
$ edgeprotecttools device-list
```


# Interface and Usage
For instructions how to use common commands, see [README_GENERAL.md](https://github.com/Infineon/edgeprotecttools/blob/master/docs/README_GENERAL.md).

For instructions how to use target-specific commands, see the corresponding readme file in the [docs](https://github.com/Infineon/edgeprotecttools/blob/master/docs) directory.


# Logging
Every time the tool is invoked, a new log file is created in the _logs_ directory of the project. By default, the console output has INFO logging severity. The log file contains the DEBUG logging severity.


# Known Issues
- Using the policy from CySecureTools 4.0.0 in projects created by CySecureTools 4.1.0 causes the CY_FB_INVALID_IMG_JWT_SIGNATURE error during re-provisioning on PSoC64-2M devices:
```
  ...
  ERROR : SFB status: CY_FB_INVALID_IMG_JWT_SIGNATURE: Invalid image certificate signature. Check the log for details
```
_Workaround_:
1. Open the policy file.
2. Navigate to section 1 of the `boot_upgrade/firmware`.
3. Set `boot_auth` and `bootloader_keys` as follows:
```
"boot_auth": [
    3
],
"bootloader_keys": [
    {
        "kid": 3,
        "key": "../keys/cy_pub_key.json"
    }
]
```
- During the installation of the package via _pip_ on Mac OS Big Sur, the following exception is raised:
```
  ...
  distutils.errors.DistutilsError: Setup script exited with error: SandboxViolation:
  mkdir('/private/var/root/Library/Caches/com.apple.python/private/tmp/easy_install-y8c1npmz', 511) {}

  The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system
  that are not within the EasyInstall build area, and has been aborted.

  This package cannot be safely installed by EasyInstall, and may not
  support alternate installation locations even if you run its setup
  script by hand.  Please inform the package's author and the EasyInstall
  maintainers to find out if a fix or workaround is available.
```
_Solution:_ Upgrade the `pip` package running the following command from the terminal: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
