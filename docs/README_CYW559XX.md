# Secure Certificates
Secure boot is based on certificate chain mechanisms using the RSA private and public key schemes.
The certificate structure consists of the following parts:
* Header, which includes information such as certificate type, version, size, owner, flags, and validity
period.
* Certificate data, which includes public key and other information that must be signed.
* Signature, which is calculated over the header and certificate data by using RSA PSS scheme.

The link between a certificate and its next certificate is that the certificate includes the hash of the public key
of the next certificate.
There are two different types of certificates:
* Key certificate
* Content certificate

The certificate chain is composed of three self-signed certificates. Self-signed means that the public key 
is included in the certificate and the certificate itself is signed with the corresponding private key. 
The chain consists of two key certificates and one content certificate.

## Key Certificate
The key certificate is used to validate the hash of the public key of next certificate in the chain.
